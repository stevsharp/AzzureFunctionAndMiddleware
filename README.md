Azure Function with Middleware for Simple Authorization
This repository contains a simple Azure Function application that demonstrates how to implement middleware for basic authorization in Azure Functions.

Overview
The application consists of an Azure Function with an HTTP trigger. Middleware is used to perform basic authorization by validating a simple API key passed in the request header. If the API key is valid, the function proceeds with the intended operation; otherwise, it returns a "Forbidden" response.

Features
Azure Function with HTTP trigger.
Middleware for basic authorization using API key.
Simple implementation for demonstration purposes.
Prerequisites
Azure Functions Core Tools
.NET SDK
Visual Studio Code or any other preferred code editor
Getting Started

Copy code
cd AzzureFunctionAndMiddleware
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
Run the application locally:
bash
Copy code
func start
Test the Azure Function using a tool like curl or Postman by sending a request with the appropriate API key in the header.
Configuration
To configure the application, modify the local.settings.json file:

ApiKey: Set the API key used for authorization.
Usage
To use the Azure Function with middleware for authorization:

Ensure the Azure Function is deployed to your Azure environment.
Set the appropriate API key in the request header when calling the function.
